There's been [a lot of fury](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/issues/1433) from the general ecosystem about retiring `project.json`.

It had to be done if Microsoft didn't want to work in parallel on 2 different build systems with different ideas and different maintainers.

Without restarting the war that was the previous GitHub issue, let's see what the new project system is all about!

### csproj instead of project.json

First, we're back with csproj.

### Are you going to use it?

When new features are introduced in a language, I like to ask people whether it's a feature they would use.

So please leave me a comment and let me know if binary or separators are a feature that will be used.
