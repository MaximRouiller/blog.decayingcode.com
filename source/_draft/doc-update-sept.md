**tldr; This is a status update on the .NET documentation. If you want me to do more of those (once a month), please let me know in the comments!**

**Comment: If you have suggestions, please let me know in the comments. Any product feedback will be forwarded to the proper product team.**

Hi everyone!

This is the fourth month where I post a summary of all .NET-related documentation that were significantly updated. This month covers all changes from September 1st to September 27th.

My name is Maxime Rouiller and I'm a Cloud Advocate with Microsoft. For this month, I'm covering three major products:

* .NET, which had ~474 commits, and 3,492 changed files on their [docs repository](https://github.com/dotnet/docs) and ~96 PRs on their [API docs repository](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
* ASP.NET, which had ~282 commits, and 1,102 changed files on their [docs repository](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs)
* NuGet, which had ~109 commits, and 45 changed files on their [docs repository](https://github.com/NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget)

For this month, I'll be trying something new. I will not be leaving a comment beside each article and will instead use a Legend with emojis (I know, it's Reddit. What am I doing!?). Thing is, it's easier to show you what's what than explain it. Where relevant, I will leave notes.

## Legend

* üì¢: Major/Main article that every one will want to read
* üí•: Important/Must read.
* ‚ú®: Brand new page

Note: It's not because a page doesn't have an icon that it is not important. Everything here is either brand new or significantly modified.

## Themes this month

### eBook - ASP.NET Core gRPC for WCF Developers - gRPC for WCF Developers üí•‚ú®

Lots of you have asked me last month about how to handle gRPC coming from a WCF point of view. Well, this month is your time to shine. There's a literal book being currently written about it. The whole thing is brand new is aimed at developers that were, surprise surprise, using WCF before.

This books take you from migration, load balancing, kubernetes, error handling, security, to why even use it. It is a must read.

### Tooling, Tutorial, Serialization, Exceptions, and Others

Machine learning tutorial? Yes. We haven't gotten enough of them that's for sure. Machine learning is becoming omnipresent and starting with a tutorial sure is a good way to learn.

* ['Tutorial: Analyze sentiment of movie reviews using a pre-trained TensorFlow model'](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/text-classification-tf?wt.mc_id=)
* [Load data from files and other sources](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/load-data-ml-net?wt.mc_id=)

The JSON serializer is brand new. Have you tried it? Those articles are your perfect start to understanding how it works. Including the most fun data type to serialize, `DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset`.

With the new tooling and .NET being used on the daily, you're bound to run into issues. The first article handle the possible issues you might run into. The second, shows you how to make localized exception messages. Neat ü§ñüì∑.

Lots of fundamental articles has been updated to the 3.0 release. 

You will find here updated articles, samples, and general tidying of articles (typos, more snippets, clarifications).

### gRPC

So you're not the *book* kind of developer. You'd rather jump in the code and try right away. I get that. After you get up to date as to what is gRPC on .NET Core, we're getting right into how to integrate with gRPC services. Straight to the code.

* [Introduction to gRPC on .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/index?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* ‚ú® [Call gRPC services with the .NET client](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/client?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* ‚ú® [gRPC client factory integration in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/clientfactory?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* ‚ú® [Logging and diagnostics in gRPC on .NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/grpc/diagnostics?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)

### MVC

Updated article about testing controller logic. Finally, there were some docs missing about Tag Helpers. This is now a solved problem. See below.

* [Test controller logic in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/testing?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* ‚ú® [Link Tag Helper in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/link-tag-helper?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* ‚ú® [Script Tag Helper in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/built-in/script-tag-helper?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)

### SignalR

We were missing a page about what feature each of our client supports. Check out the brand new page below. Then, since SignalR has dropped `UseSignalR()` everywhere and you now need to use `UseEndpoints(...)`, all of our docs now accurately represent how to set this up.

* ‚ú® [SignalR client features](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/client-features?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* [Authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/authn-and-authz?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* [Host ASP.NET Core SignalR in background services](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/background-services?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* [ASP.NET Core SignalR configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/configuration?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* [Security considerations in ASP.NET Core SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/security?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)
* [Use ASP.NET Core SignalR with TypeScript and Webpack](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/tutorials/signalr-typescript-webpack?wt.mc_id=&view=aspnetcore-3.0)

### WebAPI

After releasing the `Microsoft.dotnet-openapi` global tool, it is important to have documentation for it. That's in the first article. A new article on customizing your error handling with ASP.NET Core Web API is definitely a must read as well.

For the rest, you will find here updated samples, and general tidying of articles (typos, more snippets, clarifications).

### Host and Deploy

Tons of updates on hosting with the new release of 3.0 in GA. With the release of Blazor Server-Side, this documentation also needed major updates. If you are using Blazor today, make sure to read this to avoid problems in the future. Health checks now get wrapped under `UseEndpoints` which required its documentation to be changed as well.
