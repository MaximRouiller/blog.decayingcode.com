Here is some content to keep you busy for the weekend.

First Authorization and Help pages for mobile services in .NET, the new JSON editor of V2013 Update 2 CTP2 and what’s new with it.

Then, I’m giving a link to an awesome tool. It’s called MiniProfiler. Awesome when you need something small to see what’s taking so long in your app.

And for the weekend, videos! Both from Channel 9\. 

I’m hoping that you’ll enjoy all your weekends!
