I found tonight an interesting site that built an application that insert the lyrics inside your mp3 collection.

It requires iTunes and the .NET framework.

It can be found [here](http://derreckdean.wordpress.com/2008/09/10/lyrics-on-the-iphone-and-late-night-coding-sessions/). I will rewrite the application in C#, improve the source and contact the author if we can put it in Google Code or Codeplex.

Enjoy!
