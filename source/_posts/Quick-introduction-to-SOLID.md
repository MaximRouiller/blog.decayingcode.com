For those who don't know SOLID, it's an acronym of acronym.

### **SOLID** stands for the following:

**SRP**: Single Responsability Principle
**OCP**: Open/Closed Principle
**LSP**: Liskov Substitution Principle
**ISP**: Interface Segregation Principle
**DIP**: Dependency Inversion Principle

Bringing those principles together is creditted to Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob).

You can read about SOLID further on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_(Object_Oriented_Design)) or on [Uncle Bob's website](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod).

Please note that I'm also in the process of writing some nice posts on how to apply them to your code.

So stay tuned!
