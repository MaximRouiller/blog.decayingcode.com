We do have some very great content today. Do not miss out on the architecture section since they are very interesting. We also have some deep-dive on OWIN host and a detailed explanation of the ASP.NET MVC execution pipeline.

If you are trying out ElasticSearch and thinking about putting it in production, do check the pre-flight checklist to ensure that you optimize/secure your instance as much as possible.

As a bonus, a video about WolfSpider a graph tool that groups your contacts together and separate them. Lots of not-.NET tech in there but the video is worth it.

Enjoy!
