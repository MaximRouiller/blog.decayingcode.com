So I’m not doing this often but I saw a lot of content this morning so instead of pushing one huge list at the end of the day, I thought about pushing it in an earlier instalment. 

It will give you some time to read during lunch maybe. So we get little ASP.NET per se but we got some very interestiung OAuth and OWIN. I decided to repost a few of them since they were posted days apart. 

From the kingpin of Backbone.js (Derick Baily) come his “lesson learned” from his ad about [his book](http://backboneplugins.com/). 

Finally, a feature comparison smackdown between Solr and ElasticSearch.

Enjoy!
