So I’ve been trying different kind of library that are based on d3.js. Most of them are awesome and … I know I’m going to forget some of them. So I decided to build a list and try to arrange them by categories. 

### Charts

*   [DimpleJS](http://www.dimplejs.org/) – Easy API, lots of different type of graphs, easy to use <li>[C3.js](http://c3js.org/) – Closer to the data than dimple but also a bit more powerful <li>[NVD3.js](http://nvd3.org/) – Similar to Dimple, require a CSS for proper usage <li>[Epoch](http://fastly.github.io/epoch/) – Seems to be more focused on real-time graphs <li>[Dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/) – Focus on huge dataset <li>[Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) – Lots of easy chart to choose from. Used by Shutterstock 

### Graphs

Since I haven’t had the chance to try them out, I won’t be able to provide more detailed comments about them. If you want me to update my post, hit me up on Twitter [@MaximRouiller](https://twitter.com/MaximRouiller). 

*   [SigmaJS](http://sigmajs.org/) <li>[InsightJS](https://github.com/ignacioola/insights) <li>[JSNetworkX](http://felix-kling.de/JSNetworkX/index.html) 

### Data Visualization Editor

*   [Raw](http://raw.densitydesign.org/) – Focus on bringing data from spreadsheets online by simply copy/pasting it. <li>[Tributary](http://tributary.io/) – Not simply focused on graphics, allows you to edit numbers, colors and such with a user friendly interface. 

### Geographical maps

*   [DataMaps](http://datamaps.github.io/) – Not a library per say but a set of examples that you can copy/paste and edit to match what you want.
