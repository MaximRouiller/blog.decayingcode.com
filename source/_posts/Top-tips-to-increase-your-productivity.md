In fact... there is only one.

Stop browsing. Start working.

Nothing makes better sense than that. We are constantly surrounded by information from every kind and from all kinds of source. May they be "normal news" or Microsoft announcements or even nice piece of code on [Dzone](http://www.dzone.com) or [Dotnetkicks](http://www.dotnetkicks.com) or spending "a few minutes" on [reddit](http://reddit.com), the most important thing is... stop it.

Keep those for home browsing.

You should see your productivity sky rocket immediately.

Don't wait until someone tells you.
