So after a long weekend a few skipped days to relax, I’m coming back with&nbsp; more links! 

First, if you are following OWIN, a new release of the OWIN IIS Host has been released. Still in pre-alpha but hey, it’s there! Then there’s two excellent articles on Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to read that I would suggest personally and finally, 2 more post about Web API.

That’s for today. I’ll find you some more tomorrow.
