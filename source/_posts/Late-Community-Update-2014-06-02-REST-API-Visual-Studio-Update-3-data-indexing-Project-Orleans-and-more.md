So I was at the MVP Open Days and I’ve missed a few days. It seems that my fellow MVP James Chambers has started a great initiative about exploring Bootstrap and MVC with lots of tips and tricks. Do not miss out!

Otherwise, this is your classic “I’ve missed a few days so here are 20,000 interesting links that you must read” kind of day. 

Enjoy!
