I'm happy to announce you that I've been selected to present a session at the [Montreal CodeCamp](http://www.codecampmontreal.com).

My session is going to be focussed on Moq and unit testing. Since simply looking at a framework can be done simply, I'll be going over the framework and many "how-to". I'll also try to fit a few interesting demo with some "refactoring for unit test". Of course, this will all be centered around "best practices" since it's the theme of this year.

See you all there!
