Let’s start this post by saying that we have a poster of the .NET universe in 2013\. Downloadable directly from Microsoft. Very fun to look at and hang on the ceiling of your living room after being moved to the couch by your significant other for trying to do the same thing in the bedroom.

Then we have the usual Scott Hanselman post about some WebAPI and how to go around server host that do not allow PUT/DELETE verbs.

Finally, since I’m a big fan of ElasticSearch, I’m including their changelog for what’s new in the newest release.

Enjoy!
