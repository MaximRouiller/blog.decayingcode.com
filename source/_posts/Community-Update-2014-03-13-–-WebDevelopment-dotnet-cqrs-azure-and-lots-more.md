Welcome to the community update folks! 

I’m still experimenting with “categories” for the links. If some of them makes no sense to you, let me know and I’ll adapt. Today, we literally have a truckload of links ranging from Web Development to Agility.

I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoyed gathering and reading them.

Enjoy!
