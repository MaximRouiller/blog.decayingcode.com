If you haven’t seen the debate on “Is TDD Dead?”, you should definitely take a look at it. The debate include [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck), [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/MartinFowler) and [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.twitter.com/dhh) (creator of Ruby On Rails). The debate is basically around “Is TDD making your code badly design?”. There is currently 3 videos and there is going to be one more on next Tuesday.

Enjoy
