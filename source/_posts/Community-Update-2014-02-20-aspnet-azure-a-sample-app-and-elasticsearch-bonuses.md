So first of all, we have new releases coming from Azure, if you’re not registered yet… subscribe to The Gu’s blog and never miss it again!

Then we have a SqlDependency/SqlCacheDependcy with EF for ASP.NET Caching and one nice sample SPA application with Angular and WebAPI.

As always, a bonus on ElasticSearch including on how to deploy ElasticSearch on Azure.

Enjoy!
