Okay, my first link is a video of a project that runs a Self-Hosted OWIN server on a Raspberri PI with Mono. How awesome is that? [Open-source awesome](https://github.com/neutmute/RPi.Demo) that is! Okay… it says that it’s slow but still… who dreamt of running that on this type of devices?

That part done, you will find some more link on extending System.Web.Optimization as well as the new Identity framework. 

Make sure to take a look at the many discussions listed on how REST API versioning is done in the wild.

Bonus: ElasticSeach as usual. 

Enjoy
