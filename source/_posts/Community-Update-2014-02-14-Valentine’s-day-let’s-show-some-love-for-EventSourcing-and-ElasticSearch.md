So not much time for blogging for this Valentine’s day community update. However, there is a nice article from InfoQ about high availability and Event Sourcing. Definitely a must read/watch.

And we’ll close the lover’s day by 2 articles on scaling ElasticSearch. You might have already seen the first one but in cased you missed it, it’s there!

Enjoy!
