Very interesting content today. Howard Dierking released a RC1 of the OWIN static file middleware. If you are using a previous package, you want to upgrade now (and don’t forget the pre-release flag). 

Ever wanted to log your JavaScript output to the database for further inspection? Maybe you have a Single Page Application and you need error on the JavaScript side to be logged to the server? JSNLOG is there for you! Check it out!

If you are using F#, new templates are now available for download. Don’t miss out on the new templates for WebAPI, MSTest as well as Nancy.

Finally, if you are still missing out on the new vision of ASP.NET (a.k.a. One ASP.NET), you will want to read the article dedicated to that. A must read!

Finally, Imran Baloch deliver us a barebone implementation of the new Identity component for ASP.NET. I should have to say it again but… it’s also a must read.

On that, enjoy!
