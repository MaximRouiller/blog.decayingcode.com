We start with efficient querying by Jimmy Bogard then Basic HTTP Auth with WebAPI. 

Mads Kristensen provides us a very nice article about cache busting in ASP.NET. I’ve also included some miscellaneous articles about high scalability, an Uncle Bob article and an article about the use of Windows Azure with Titanfall (a video game). Very interesting stuff.

As always, I end up with an article on ElasticSearch.

Enjoy!
