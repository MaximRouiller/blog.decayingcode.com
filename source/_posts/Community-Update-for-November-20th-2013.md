Among the different things that grabbed the community interested today were pretty much all about ASP.NET.

We have two video links (Thanks Channel 9!) that shows the integration of Bootstrap in the latest release of MVC as well as the authentication using the new Identity system. If you are a fan of WebAPI, don’t miss out on the batch support in WebAPI 2 as well as how to unit test a controller.

I hope you enjoy this small bundle of links for today!
