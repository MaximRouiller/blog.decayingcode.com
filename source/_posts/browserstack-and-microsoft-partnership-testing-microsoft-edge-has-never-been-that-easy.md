[Microsoft just announced a partnership with BrowserStack](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/30/free-edge-testing-browserstack/) to provide free testing of Microsoft Edge.

You probably already BrowserStack has the place to go when you need to test multiple browsers without installing them all on your machine.

Today, you can expand your manual and automated test to always include Microsoft Edge.

Not only that, they include 3 channels: Latest 2 stable versions as well as the preview (available to Insiders).

This will enable you to ensure that your application works on most Edge browsers as well as future proofing yourself with the next release.
