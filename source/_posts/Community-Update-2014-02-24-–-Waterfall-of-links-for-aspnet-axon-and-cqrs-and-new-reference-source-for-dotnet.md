> Side note: So the software I built to gather links for all of you has been migrated to a worker role in Windows Azure. That means that I don’t need to run a machine all the time to gather data. That also means that I will be retrieving more data during the weekend whereas before it would not have been possible. Soon, I’ll also be crawling RSS feed for more detailed links and metadata. 

Today is the day of ASP.NET. We’ve seen days with many subjects with sparse amount of articles. Today is not that day for ASP.NET. We have some very nice article yet again.

So enjoy this wonderful content!

PS.: We also have a link for the new reference source for .NET and a CQRS link also. Don’t miss out!
