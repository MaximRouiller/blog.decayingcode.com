It looks like today is the day of ASP.NET, OWIN and REST API versioning.

Among those, I would recommend checking out the video by Damian Edwards (one of the guy that works on SignalR) about what NOT to do. If you don’t have the time, at least read the article by Scott Hanselman.

As an additional bonus, a simple post about data visualization with nothing else than ElasticSearch and D3.

Enjoy!
