Hi everyone,

My name's Maxim and I'm from Montreal, Quebec in Canada.

I decided to start a blog mainly because I want to have an online presence and I think I can bring a lot of information to the community which is not currently/properly available.

The main focus will be on .NET. I will be mainly posting code, demo, links that I think are relevant and should be looked into.

I do have a true passion about technology and hope I can actually help out on this side.

See you all later
