> So this is the update from yesterday. I left a little bit too fast and totally forgot to press Publish. So there will be another post today. 

A series of video has been released by Microsoft with Scott Hanselman and Scott Hunter to show you how to build modern web apps with ASP.NET. You don’t want to miss that so I linked to Scott Hanselman’s announcement as well as the series on Channel 9\. Included in this, we have a Visual Studio Magazine article on transitioning from ASP.NET to Windows 8 development.

And a rare article in French on CQRS for those that are interested.

Enjoy!
