First, a few filters with ASP.NET. Rendering your content as PDF with Jimmy Bogard’s (you should subscribe to his blog!) as well as a Visual Studio Magazine article that’s worth reading.

As for ElasticSearch, we have a nice article on its distributed nature as well as how to establish a “river” on ElasticSearch.

So on this very slow news Friday, I’ll wish you all a nice weekend.
