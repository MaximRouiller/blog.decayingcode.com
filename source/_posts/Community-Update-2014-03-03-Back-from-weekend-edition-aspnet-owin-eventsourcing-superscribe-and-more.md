As I don’t always post during the weekend, I normally what was shared during the weekend into a big news update on Monday. 

So because of this, today we have a shotgun spray of subjects. First, ASP.NET and everything related closely or not to it.

As always, Hanselman brings us a nice post that could have gone to the ASP.NET section but hey… it’s Hanselman!

Then a routing tool for OWIN and of course… the ElasticSearch bonus.

Enjoy!

**P.S.**: If you want to comment, I’ve migrated everything to Disqus.
