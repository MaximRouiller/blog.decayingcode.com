Hello everyone!

So Greg Young was on fire last night/this morning. He wrote 4 blog posts on Sublime Text. A must read! I have a few links in web development, including OAuth, but most importantly, TDD in Javascript.

So with the usual .NET, ASP.NET,etc. I wish you all an happy reading.

Also, if you are not aware yet, the MVP Program is changing its guideline for admission. You can [view here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=GzpVG3z93r0). So if you are part of an Open Source project involving .NET, you might be eligible for becoming an MVP on that alone.

Enjoy!
