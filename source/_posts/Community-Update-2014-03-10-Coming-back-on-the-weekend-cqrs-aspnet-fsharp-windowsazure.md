So for this weekend, here is what we have. Three nice articles about Push Notification with Android, ASP.NET Identity and EF6, per-request tracing in WebAPI.

Then we have an article by Greg Young on CQRS and Task Based UIs, a video about DDD, Event Sourcing, CQRS with F#. Do not miss the wiki on basics of an event store.

For the F# nerds here, I re-included the same video… yeah I know but I really don’t want you to miss it guys. Also, we have a sample for the Identity provider for F#.

Finally for the nerd in all of us, a simple blog on how they do logging and dashboards at CERN (Nuclear research in Europe).

Enjoy!
