Alright, after our small ALT.NET meeting (with beer) at O'Reagan Irish Pub, we decided to organize a coding dojo. If anybody is interested, please leave a comment on the blog or contact me via Twitter ([@MaximRouiller](http://twitter.com/MaximRouiller)).

The Coding Dojo will happen on Thursday, May 21st. It will start at 5:30pm and **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span>** include free pizza. No guarantee but I'll try. We don't have a local yet but I'll keep you all updated as soon as we find one.

The Coding Dojo will be oriented around TDD and will take the format of a RandoriKata.

Who will participate?
