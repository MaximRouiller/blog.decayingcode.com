Not necessarily a lot of content today but a few stuff that is super interesting. First, John Galloway brings us in the future of ASP.NET for 2014\. A must read of course.

Do not miss the free book by Stanford University about Information Retrieval. If you are using ElasticSearch with Azure VMs, you will want this plugin that will allow you to scale any ElasticSearch cluster directly in the cloud without any big problems.

Enjoy the weekend!
