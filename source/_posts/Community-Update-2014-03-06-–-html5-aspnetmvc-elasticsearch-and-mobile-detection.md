Few articles for today but hey… at least I only get the best for all of you!

So we have HTML5 and offline applications with ASP.NET MVC, ElasticSearch with multilingual text (for all of you from India/France/United Kingdom). Then we have a website that helps you detect mobile browsers and allows you to download the proper code to do it.

And we finish that with a tech review from Scott Hanselman from 3 Lenovo Laptops.
