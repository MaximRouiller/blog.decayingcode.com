So I’ve got an engagement to speak about Ajax with Visual Studio 2010\. Of course, I’m talking about jQuery but there is obviously the Ajax Control Toolkit available for the people who are still on ASP.NET WebForm.

With such a huge focus right now on ASP.NET MVC, is the Ajax Control Toolkit still relevant?

The [website](http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/samples/) is still there, the link toward the forums doesn’t work anymore and of course there is this gem :
  > AJAX Control Toolkit Release Notes - September 2009 Release Version 3.0.30930  

We are 1 year and a half since the last major release. Of course, the [CodePlex project](http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/) is still there but the [reviews](http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/releases/view/43475#ReviewsAnchor) are not encouraging me to use it.

Hell, the project could not even be mentioned as [actively maintained](http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets) anymore. One commit a month is hardly what I call support for such a project.

So the question remains… is it still relevant today? Will it ever be updated in the future?
