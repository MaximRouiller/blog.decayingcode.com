This week is purely ASP.NET. I’ll keep this short and sweet but everything down here is worth taking your time for a slow read on the train/metro/bus back home.

Then I suggest that you take it easy for the weekend. Christmas is coming and you’ll all need to relax before partying. ![Smile](/posts/files/wlEmoticon-smile_1.png)

Enjoy!
