So during the weekend, there was a bit of everything. There is a nice introduction on how to debug OWIN apps as well as playing with the new OWIN on IIS layer that is demoed by Rick Strahl. As for the new ASP.NET Identity mechanism, Olav Nybø goes over the new features and explain the structure and logic behind the new system while Abhimanyu Kumar Vatsa explains how to customize it to your needs.

If you are more interested in WebAPI, there’s a nice tutorial on how to build proper action filters for async methods as well a dissection of WebAPI Individual Accounts Template.

I’m hoping you’ll be enjoying this reading list for today. 

Cheers!
