Here is what we have for the community. First, a great warning from [Levi Broderick](https://twitter.com/LeviBroderick/status/409736021018832896) about how medium trust is dead. This link will bring you to a KB from Microsoft that will give you all the details you need to know about that. 

Then we have a nice tutorial from [www.asp.net](http://www.asp.net) that will show us how to use external authentication services. Sam Jenkins show how to implement Two Factor Authentication in ASP.NET MVC. 

Finally, did you know that JSON.NET allows you to convert XML from and to JSON? Check it out.
