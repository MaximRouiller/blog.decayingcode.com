> NOTE: As an MVP, I have a licence for ReSharper that is provided for free by JetBrains. However, I am not paid by JetBrains for this post. I just love the tool and want to keep you guys updated. 

First of all, [here is the download link](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/index.html). With that out of the way, here’s what’s new.

*   Support for **TypeScript**. So if you were still wondering if it was just a fad or not, well… 3rd party provider started supporting it.  <li>Integrated experience with Peek Definition and Enhanced scrollbar (aka the Christmas Tree)  <li>More C# inspections. This means that ReSharper will find more issue than before and more opportunities to clean up your code.  <li>Improvements to JavaScript support. ReSharper is always a bit less feature-full with JavaScript but they are still working on it.  <li>Improved the XAML tooling. For those of you that are into XAML and are following my blog, well you just got served.
