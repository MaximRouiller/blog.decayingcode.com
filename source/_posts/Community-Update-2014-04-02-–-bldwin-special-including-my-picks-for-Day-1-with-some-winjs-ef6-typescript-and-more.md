Okay so… if you haven’t heard yet… the BUILD is on. I mean… really. Tons of sessions and more time to waste than you would admit. 

So to simplify your life, I’ve built a playlist that is oriented toward the web. If you think I missed something, you should tell me. 

Don’t forget to watch for tomorrow where I’ll post my picks for Day 2.

Enjoy!
