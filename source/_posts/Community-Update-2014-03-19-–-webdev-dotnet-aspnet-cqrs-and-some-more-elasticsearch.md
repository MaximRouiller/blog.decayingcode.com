First of all, I would like to mention that there is less than [19 days left until Windows XP support goes out](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/end-of-support.aspx). It’s been a nice 12 years and a half going. That means that if your child was born on the day of the release, he would now be in 7th grade. It’s been a nice and long run but it’s time to pull the plug. If your enterprise is still running Windows XP (other than in a VM to show rookies what it looked like back in the days), then it’s time to change. 

That being said, here are today’s link! 

Enjoy!
