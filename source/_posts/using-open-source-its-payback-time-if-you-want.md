Most of the developers I know are actually very passionate about what they do and choose the best tool for the job. Sometimes this means that you use Microsoft tools and sometimes, you use open source.

If you are interested in giving back to the community, a website has been established to list all the projects that has simple bugs and/or features that are not assigned to anyone and are… up for grabs.

From Glimpse to Octokit.NET wihout forgetting NuGet, you can find all those list and more [right here](http://up-for-grabs.net/).

Enjoy!
