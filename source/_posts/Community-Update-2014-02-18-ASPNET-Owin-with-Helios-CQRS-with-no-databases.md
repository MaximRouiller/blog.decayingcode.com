So just a few links today.

First we have a nice Web Developer checklist that I think everyone should see. Then Levi Broderick write us a niec intro to what is Project Helios. If you are the least bit concerned with ASP.NET, it should be on your top articles to read today. No exceptions.

Finally, we have a nice article from Gabriel Schenker about not using a database when using an article similar to CQRS.

And as always, a little bonus on an ElasticSearch 101\. 

Enjoy!
