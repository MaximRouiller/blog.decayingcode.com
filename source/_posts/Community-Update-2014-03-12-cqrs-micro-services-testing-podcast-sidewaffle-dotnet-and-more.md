So for today, I&rsquo;ve gathered the best of the best for all of you. We have a nice discussion about Micro services including an article by Martin Fowler describing them. Followed by a book download for the white paper by Microsoft &ldquo;**Exploring CQRS**&rdquo; and a blog post by Greg Young about Event Sourcing.

Beside including some articles on testing, I&rsquo;ve included the **Ultimate list of Developer Podcasts**. Seriously&hellip; this one, do not miss out. You have to take a look.

Have you seen **SideWaffle**? Do you even know what it is? No? Watch the video on Channel 9 by Mads Kristensen. It&rsquo;s worth it.

Then we reach the big .NET section. All of those article are worth a read by their own. The post by Jonathan Oliver is especially worth it if you&rsquo;ve been developing in a .NET world for a long time. It will help you put things in perspective.

Then we finish with an interest-grabbing title of a blog post:&nbsp; &ldquo;Why you should never use MongoDB&rdquo;. Long, but also essential in knowing exactly what you are getting into with object databases.

**Bonus**: as always&hellip; ElasticSearch!

Enjoy!
