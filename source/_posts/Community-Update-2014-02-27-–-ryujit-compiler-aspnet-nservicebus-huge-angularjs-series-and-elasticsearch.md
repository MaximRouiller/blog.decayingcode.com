The RyuJIT compiler is being moved to CTP2 and there’s a whole blog post about it! You should take a look. As for ASP.NET, we have a security article that is always interesting and a roadmap for OpenID Connect and IdentityServer.

Gabriel Schenker brings us a huge series on AngularJS, I’ve brought you the table of content rather than individual episodes.&nbsp; Enjoy!

Bonus as always, ElasticSearch!
