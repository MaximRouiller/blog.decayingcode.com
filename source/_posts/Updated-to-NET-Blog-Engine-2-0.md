Well hello everyone,

So I updated from Blogger to .NET Blog Engine 2.0\. The transfer was painful indeed. Blogger isnâ€™t supporting a pure BlogML markup and I had to convert everything to the new format. Including of course fixing all the slugs and the old url so that they could still works.

Since this new engine will allow me more flexibility, the frequency of posts shall increase.

See you all later!
