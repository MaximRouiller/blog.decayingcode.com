First we have a nice post on MSDN about integrating claims with OWIN. I’ve read the article and it’s definitely easier. 

Then we have the integration of the OWIN pipeline with the new .NET Azure Mobile Services as well as a test drive of the WS-Federation in the new Katana 3.0.0-alpha1 (available on NuGet with the -Pre flag).

Finally, serving WebP images with ASP.NET MVC.

Enjoy the weekend!
