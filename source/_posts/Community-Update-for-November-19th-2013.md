Yesterday, not as much on ASP.NET as I would have liked.

However, we’ve got some great new F# package for OWIN as well as some Authorization with WebAPI. If you are building on those, ensure that you are actually reading those article as securing a Web API is now possible out of the box.

As for Visual Studio and ASP.NET, we get a more detailed explanation of what One ASP.NET is, a Visual Studio 2012 Update (2012.2) and a quick look at Visual Studio Online Code Named “Monaco”.

Enjoy!
