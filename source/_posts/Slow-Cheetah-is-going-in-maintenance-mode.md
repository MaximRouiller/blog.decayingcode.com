Just a quick blog post to let you know that [it has been announced](https://github.com/sayedihashimi/slow-cheetah/issues/158) that Slow Cheetah is going in Maintenance Mode. I don’t have alternatives or scoop. 

I’m just trying to get the word out as much as possible.

### What is Slow Cheetah?

It’s a tool to transform XML files from App.config and <strike>Web.config</strike> (this will not be affected).

What does that mean for me?

It means that it won’t be supported in the next release of Visual Studio. No new features are going to be added. No fixes for future regressions are going to be applied.

### What does it really mean?

Stop using it. It will still work for your current project but if you are expecting a quick migration when you upgrade Visual Studio, think again.

It might work but nothing is guaranteed. 

### What if I don’t want to change?

The code is open sourced. You can start maintaining it yourself but Sayed won’t be doing any more work on it.
