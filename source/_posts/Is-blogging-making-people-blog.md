I have a colleague that have [his own blog](http://blog.decarufel.net). When I started blogging, it was because of Jeff Atwood's [post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000516.html) about starting to write and him having say on StackOverflow's podcast that he's not always right but that he have an online presence and that he's loud.

I agree. Having a blog and writing it (useful or not) is a way to broadcast yourself. Having a blog (depending on what you it) can be good for your career and can also serve as a way to store your personal knowledge that you gained through out projects.

I'm happy that I started my blog. It's kind of a technical diary and I'm more than happy to write to it when I have a moment.

To go back to my colleague, he's a nice guy with a huge technical knowledge. What I'm proud of is this. I started my blog in 2009 and he had his since 2007\. During 2007 and 2008 he wrote an average of 5-8 post per years. When I started my blog, he followed me on my journey and we started comparing Google Analytics total number of visits. That's when the friendly competition started.

He knew that I would win easily if he wasn't going to post something interesting. So he started following me. That's why I say that blogging is contagious.

Now instead of making around 8 blog post a year, he makes 8+ a month.

Is that THAT contagious or are we the only duo of blogger like that?
