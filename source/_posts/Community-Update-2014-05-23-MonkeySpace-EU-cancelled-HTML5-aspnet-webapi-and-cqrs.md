If you are European and were among the 13 who registered for MonkeySpace in Dublin, please be aware that the event was cancelled and for obvious reasons. We are always in need of good conferences and MonkeySpace had a great list of speakers. 

Maybe it was a lack of promotion but anyway. Next year? They’re trying again. Keep an eye open!

Enjoy today’s links!
