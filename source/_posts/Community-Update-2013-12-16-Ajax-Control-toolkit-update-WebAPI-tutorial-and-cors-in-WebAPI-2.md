Well Christmas is coming and it shows. Not a lot of people are actually posting new content.

First there is the December release of Ajax Control Toolkit that you should checkout if you are using WebForms. Then, there is Part 10 of the tutorial. You should checkout the rest of the tutorial which can be found within the post. Finally, an MSDN article about CORS support in WebAPI 2.

Enjoy!
