First of all, I’m extremely happy with my nomination as an ASP.NET MVP. I did a lot of presentations in the past 2 years and I’m happy that I’m considered for this award.

I would like to thank everyone who nominated me and helped me get where I am today.

[Mario Cardinal](http://www.mariocardinal.com/) helped me by backing me with the nomination. [Éric De Carufel](http://blog.decarufel.net/) is also a big part of my nomination since we started a small group (ALT.NET) more than a year ago. Since then, we’ve been working non-stop in presenting and “one-upping” each other. I would also thank [Joël Quimper](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/joelq/) for his help and my boss Yves Forget for helping me give time to those presentations.

Most of my presentations has been done at the [.NET Montreal Group](http://www.dotnetmontreal.com/) so I would lastly thank [Guy Barette](http://guy.dotnet-expertise.com/) for the opportunities he gave me as well as the inclusion of our group inside the big .NET Montreal community. 

So I’ll be participating more in the following months and I will push ASP.NET as hard as before within Montreal.

Thanks again,

-Maxime Rouiller
