Okay I might not be original but I’ve seen the work done by [Alexandre Brisebois](http://alexandrebrisebois.wordpress.com/) to keep you guys updated on what is happening in the Azure community. I thought I might want to try to do it on my own but instead of focusing on Azure, I would focus on the best and greatest of ASP.NET, JavaScript and everything web related.

If you guys like it, you might swing me a comment and I’ll make sure to continue. Here’s what I aggregated in the past few days.
